# Usage

Read `examples/*.rs` to quickly learn the recommended usage.

To run the examples, use the following commands. NOTE: `ifnone` and `lazy_catch` generate random output, thus you may run them multiple times.

```bash
cargo run --example eager_catch
cargo run --example ifnone
cargo run --example lazy_catch
```

If you are running those commands in a VSCode Shell, please try `Ctrl+LeftClick` on the `.rs` paths to navigate to the error sites.
